Random Node:
	You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch which, in addition to insert, find, and
	delete, has a method getRandomNode() which returns a random node from the tree. All nodes should
	be equally likely to be chosen. Design and implement an algorithmfor getRandomNode(), and explain
	how you would implement the rest of the methods.
Hints:
	#42: Be careful that to ensure that each node is equally likely and that your solution doesn't
	slow down the speed of standard binary search tree algorithms.
	#54: This is your implementation, which means you may need to store additional information.
	#62: As a naive algorithm, can you use a tree traversal algorithm to implement this algorithm?
	What is the runtime of this?
	#75: Alternatively, you could pick a random depth to traverse to and then randomly traverse, 
	stopping when you get to that depth. Does this work?
	#89: Picking a random depth won't help much since there are more nodes at lower depths. Re-balancing
	probabilities is possibly useful.
	#99: Randoming between 1 & 3 doesn't work. Why not?
	#112: We can pick a random number between 1 and size_of_tree. This resolves this issue for the root
	but not the other nodes.
	#119: We need to weight the probability of going left and right based on the number of nodes on
	each side. How does this work exactly? How can we know the number of nodes?
