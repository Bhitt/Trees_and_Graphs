Minimal Tree:
	Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create
	a binary search tree with minimal height.
Hints:
	#19: How would you ensure that about the same number of nodes are on the left of the root as on
	the right?
	#73: Finding the optimal item to insert seems inefficient. Can you use recursion instead and divide
	this into subproblems?
	#116: Imagine we had a createMinimalTree method that returns a minimal tree for a given array (but
	for some strange reason doesn't operate on the root of the tree). Could you use this to operate
	on the root of the tree? Could you write the base case for the function? Great! Then that's
	basically the entire function.
